## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-12

### 📌 Agent Communication Protocol Upgrade

Minimal, backward-compatible upgrade to agent response formats and dispatch protocols.

#### Added
- **Status Field** — All 13 worker agents now include `📌 Status: OK | PARTIAL | FAIL | BLOCKED` in their response headers
- **Dispatch Metadata** — Entry points (`spec`, `implement`, `init`) now include structured metadata in dispatch prompts:
  ```
  [Feature]: auth-system
  [Spec]: .ouroboros/specs/auth-system/
  [Phase]: 1/5 - Research
  ```
- **Phase Numbering** — `spec` response format now shows `2/5 - Requirements` instead of just `Requirements`
- **Non-Interactive Command Guidelines** — Added comprehensive reference tables to `coder`, `qa`, `devops`:
  | Tool | ❌ Interactive | ✅ Non-Interactive |
  |------|---------------|--------------------|
  | pnpm test | `pnpm test` (waits h/q) | `pnpm test --run` or `CI=true pnpm test` |
  | vitest | `vitest` (watch mode) | `vitest run` |
  | jest | `jest --watch` | `jest --ci` |

#### Changed
- **13 Agent Files Updated** — All worker agents now have Status field in response format
- **3 Dispatch Formats Enhanced** — `spec`, `implement`, `init` now include context metadata

#### Technical Notes
- All changes are **additive** — no existing fields removed
- Changes are **backward compatible** — old format still readable
- `archive` agent unchanged — already had complete format

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-12

### 🔄 Workflow Orchestrator Architecture

Introduced dedicated **Workflow Orchestrators** — sub-orchestrators that manage major workflows while inheriting CCL enforcement and delegation rules from the main orchestrator.

#### Added
- **4 New Workflow Agents** — Created specialized orchestrators for each major workflow:
  | Agent | Purpose |
  |-------|---------|
  | `ouroboros-init` | Project initialization workflow |
  | `ouroboros-spec` | 5-phase spec creation workflow |
  | `ouroboros-implement` | Task execution workflow |
  | `ouroboros-archive` | Archive management workflow |

- **Prompt-to-Agent Routing** — Each prompt file now routes to its dedicated agent:
  - `ouroboros-init.prompt.md` → `agent: ouroboros-init`
  - `ouroboros-spec.prompt.md` → `agent: ouroboros-spec`
  - `ouroboros-implement.prompt.md` → `agent: ouroboros-implement`
  - `ouroboros-archive.prompt.md` → `agent: ouroboros-archive`

- **Orchestrator Constraints on Workflow Agents**:
  - **BLIND/MUTE Rules**: Cannot read/write files directly → DELEGATE
  - **CCL Enforcement**: Mandatory heartbeat after every response
  - **Tool Lockdown**: `edit` and `read` tools forbidden (delegate to workers)
  - **Handoff Protocol**: Return to main orchestrator after completion

#### Changed
- **Agent Count**: 12 → 16 agents (added 4 workflow orchestrators)
- **Architecture Diagram**: Updated mermaid diagram to show workflow orchestrators
- **Routing Table**: `copilot-instructions.md` now shows agent targets for slash commands
- **File Structure**: Updated to show new agent organization

#### Fixed
- **Instructions Confusion**: Previously, prompts with `agent: ouroboros` caused instruction mixing. Now each workflow has its dedicated agent with clear boundaries.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-11

### 🚀 Major Architecture Overhaul: Centralized Orchestration

Ouroboros v2.0 introduces a strict **Hub-and-Spoke** architecture where the main `ouroboros` agent acts as the sole orchestrator, managing all subagent interactions via the native `runSubagent()` tool.

#### Changed
- **Centralized Orchestration** — The `ouroboros.agent.md` file is now the single entry point. Users should no longer interact with subagents directly.
- **Strict Subagent Delegation** — All subagent calls are now routed through `runSubagent()`. This ensures that the orchestrator maintains the context and project state.
- **Return Protocol** — Subagents are now explicitly programmed to return control to the orchestrator after completing their specific tasks, preventing "hallucinated" completions or hangs.
- **Agent Location** — Confirmed all agents reside in `.github/agents/`.

#### Added
- **TaskSync V5 Integration** — Enhanced persistence guarantees and stronger protection against context window degradation.
- **Workflow Assurance** — The new architecture guarantees that multi-step workflows (like Spec -> Implement -> Test) execute sequentially and correctly.

### 🧠 Agent Prompts Enhancement

Major upgrade to all 12 subagent prompts, leveraging the Self-Bootstrap architecture to add comprehensive guidance without impacting the orchestrator's context window.

#### Changed

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-10

### 🚀 Architecture Upgrade: Self-Bootstrap Agents

#### Changed
- **Agent Relocation** — Agents now in `.github/agents/` with `.agent.md` extension, enabling native Copilot `runSubagent(agent: "name")` calls.
- **Dispatch Protocol** — Replaced "Self-Bootstrap" with **Native Agent Dispatch**.
  - **Old**: `Read .ouroboros/agents/ouroboros-coder.prompt.md then execute...`
  - **New**: `runSubagent(agent: "ouroboros-coder", prompt: ...)` (native Copilot integration)
- **Prompt Updates** — Updated `copilot-instructions.md`, `ouroboros-implement.prompt.md`, and `ouroboros-spec.prompt.md` to enforce the new file-reading dispatch pattern.

#### Added
- **Auto-Cleanup Protocol** — Added automatic maintenance to `/ouroboros-archive`:
  - **Subagent Specs**: `.ouroboros/subagent-docs/` files older than 3 days **deleted** (transient data).
  - **Context History**: `.ouroboros/history/` files older than 7 days moved to archive (persistent data).
- **Architectural Awareness** — Subagents now automatically read the latest `history/context-*.md` before execution, ensuring they align with the current project state without prompt repetition.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-10

### 🎉 Initial Release

Project Ouroboros is a persistent context system for GitHub Copilot that reduces redundant conversations and maximizes subscription value through intelligent memory management and specialized sub-agent routing.

---

### Added

#### ♾️ Core Session System
- **Never-Ending Sessions** — AI continues indefinitely until user explicitly says "stop", "end", "terminate", or "quit"
- **Goodbye Phrase Ban** — Forbidden phrases like "Let me know if you need help" enforced system-wide
- **Continuous Command Loop (CCL)** — Terminal-based interaction via `python -c "task = input('[Ouroboros] > ')"`
- **Lossless Artifact Protocol** — Code passed verbatim between agents, never summarized or truncated

#### 🧠 Persistent Memory System
- **Template Pattern** — Templates in `templates/` are READ-ONLY; active files created in `history/`
  - `context-template.md` → `history/context-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - `project-arch-template.md` → `history/project-arch-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Automatic Context Restoration** — Session state restored from latest `history/context-*.md` on startup
- **Milestone-Based Updates** — Context files updated on major milestones, not every action

#### 🤖 Custom Agents (12 Specialists in `.github/agents/`)

**Core Agents:**
| Agent | Trigger | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| `ouroboros-coder` | implement, create, build | Full-stack development |
| `ouroboros-qa` | test, debug, fix, error, mock, coverage | Testing \& debugging (unified) |
| `ouroboros-writer` | document, explain | Documentation, no code mods |
| `ouroboros-devops` | deploy, docker | Deployment with rollback steps |
| `ouroboros-security` | security, audit | Risk identification |

| `/ouroboros-init` | First-time project research and architecture setup |
| `/ouroboros-spec` | 5-phase spec workflow (Research → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Validation) |
| `/ouroboros-implement` | Execute tasks.md with 3 speed modes |
| `/ouroboros-archive` | Archive completed specs with timestamp |

#### 📋 Spec-Driven Development (4 Phases)

| Phase | Agent | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1. Research | `ouroboros-researcher` | `research.md` — codebase analysis, affected files |
| 2. Requirements | `ouroboros-requirements` | `requirements.md` — EARS notation, numbered requirements |
| 3. Design | `ouroboros-architect` | `design.md` — architecture, Mermaid diagrams, correctness properties |
| 4. Validation | `ouroboros-validator` | `validation-report.md` — consistency check, impact analysis, risk assessment |

**Validation Phase (A+B Approach):**
- **Part A**: Generate persistent `validation-report.md` with full analysis
- **Part B**: Interactive terminal confirmation (`yes` / `revise X` / `abort`)

**Phase Execution Rules:**
- Each phase executes via `runSubagent()` and RETURNS to orchestrator
- User approval required before proceeding to next phase
- File whitelist enforced (5 allowed files per feature spec)

#### 🎮 Implementation Modes (`/ouroboros-implement`)

| Mode | Speed | Control | Best For |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| 🔧 Task-by-Task | Slowest | Highest | High-risk changes, learning |

- **Verification Gate** — Code verified via `ouroboros-security` or `ouroboros-qa` before delivery
- **QA Fix-Verify Cycle** — `ouroboros-qa` handles test+debug with 3-cycle limit to prevent infinite loops
- **Phase Reset Protocol** — Explicit rules for returning to earlier spec phases
- **File Whitelist** — Only 5 files allowed in specs: `research.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `validation-report.md`

#### 🌐 Internationalization
- **Language Mirroring** — AI replies in user's language (Chinese, English, Japanese, etc.)
